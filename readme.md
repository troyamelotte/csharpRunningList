## Console Running List:

Create a new console app that has the following functionalities:

__#1__

```
As a user
When I first open the console app
I am prompted with "Enter a name to add it to the list"
```

__#2__

```
As a user
When I enter a name
The name is added to a running list that is displayed.
```

__#3__

```
As a user
When I type "done"
I should see a prompt asking if the list should be filtered.
```

(if they say no then simply end the app there and display results).

__#4__

```
As a user
When I say yes to the filter prompt
I should see a prompt asking how many characters I want to filter with.
```

(you should take in a number and filter out all responses that have a length less than that number).

__#5__

```
As a user
When I get to the end of the app
I should see a list of all the users left.
```
